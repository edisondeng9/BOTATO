    <div class="nested-copy-line-height lh-copy serif f4 nested-links nested-img mid-gray pr4-l w-two-thirds-l"><p>Financial Independence, Retire Early (FI/RE) is a movement dedicated to savings (sometimes extreme) and investment that allows its followers to achieve financial freedom and early retirement far earlier than traditional retirement plans.</p>
<p>Some proponents of the FIRE movement have retired as early as age 30, instead of the conventional and agreed upon retirement age of 65.</p>
<p><em>Steps to Achieving FIRE</em></p>
<p>In recent years, I’ve seen more and more Malaysians embracing the FIRE movement, especially the millennials.</p>
<p>Of course, many of us are still striving to achieve financial independence, myself included. My aim is to achieve this by the age of 35. Below are some of the steps I’ve taken.</p>
<p><em>Savings</em></p>
<p>There are no shortcuts here. My savings rate has always been high and well above the average Malaysians. In the first few years of being in the traditional workforce, I saved like hell through frugality concept.</p>
<p>Asians in general are predisposed to saving from the onset. I think most families cultivate savings as a habit from a young age and that alone will set us apart from other cultures. Saving alone, I think, accounts for 50% of your FIRE journey.</p>
<p><em>EMERGENCY FUND</em></p>
<p>Saving and your emergency fund goes hand in hand. The first step is always to build a fund for emergencies.</p>
<p>An emergency fund helps in two major ways. Firstly, it gives you peace of mind. And secondly, if and when an unexpected financial crisis occurs, you won’t have to liquidate your investments to cover those costs.</p>
<p>Having set up my emergency fund, my next step was investments.</p>
<p><em>DEBT</em></p>
<p>I’ve been fortunate enough to get out of my education debt early thanks to wonderful parents.</p>
<p>Another huge debt hurdle I foresee Malaysians encountering in their lifetime is of course your mortgage. Two ways to go about this, either factor in your mortgage repayments into your annual expenses, or if it is cheaper, rent. If you’re lucky to have your parents leaving and bequeathing you the family home after they’re gone, you’re set in this department as well. Just make sure to take care of them.</p>
<p>Other debts such as credit card and personal loans, stay clear of them. If you have them, pay them off at once, then start on your emergency fund.</p>
<p><em>Grow Your Money</em></p>
<p>There are a 101 ways to grow your money. The path I’ve chosen is to invest in stocks. You may find that you have superior knowledge in other assets like real estate. Or you may prefer to put your money in robo advisors like StashAway. To each his own I say. As long as you’re investing in something that is an asset.</p>
<p>By investing in stocks, my money will grow in two ways.</p>
<p>A) CAPITAL GAINS &ndash;&gt;
A capital gain is when my stocks increase in value. For example, purchasing Nestle 2 years ago for RM70 per share. Today, that same share is worth RM140 per share, giving me a 100% or 2X in capital gain in two years.</p>
<p>The same can be said for real estate. Purchasing a residential property at RM100K 5 years ago, you may sell it for RM200K in today for the same 100% gain in five years.</p>
<p>B) PASSIVE INCOME &ndash;&gt;
To keep it simple here, passive income is income I receive without having to put in effort or work for. Through stock investment, I get passive income via dividends. As a real-life example, I received RM16,322.26 in dividend income last year from my Malaysian stock portfolio – the Freedom Fund.</p>
<p>Another example of passive income using real estate as an example is rental. The rent you receive from your tenants can be considered passive income as well.</p>
<p>The amount everyone is aiming for to FIRE is actually different. It depends on your monthly expenses. If you’re able to live on RM1,000 a month, you can achieve financial independence and retire at a much earlier age with a much smaller amount in the bank.</p>
<p><em>HOW I CALCULATE MY FI/RE AMOUNT</em></p>
<p>As a general rule of thumb, you want to have 30X your yearly expenses in the bank, the dollar amount most people go by is RM1 million. For me, I’ve calculated my annual expenses to about RM36,000. And 30X that amount is RM1.08 million.</p>
<p>This of course is my own personal amount, no family as of yet. For those that are worried about inflation, I believe that a good investment portfolio will negate the effects of inflation.</p>
<p><em>Protecting Your Money</em></p>
<p>What happens now that you’ve achieved 30X your yearly expense?</p>
<p>You’ll want to protect and continue to grow my money. Some proponents of FIRE actually stop growing their money at this stage. Instead, opting to make small withdrawals (typically 3%) a year.</p>
<p>Personally, with stocks, I aim to continue growing my portfolio from a million to much more. Retiring early isn’t a part of my plan.</p>
<p>Regardless, you will want to protect your wealth by diversifying your money into less risky assets now. At this stage, I would start moving my stocks and building a more defensive portfolio. I’ll focus on maintaining my dividend income as well as preserving my portfolio’s value. No more risky bets at this stage.</p>
<p><em>How Long Will the Money Last?</em></p>
<p>If you can get to 30 times your annual expenses, technically, that is enough for you to live off – forever.</p>
<p>With prudent management of your wealth at this point, trust me, you’ll be able to live off that portfolio for a long time. You may even have some leftover for the next generation.</p>
<p>FI/RE requires discipline and letting time work in your favor. Which is why starting early on your savings and investing is so important. Just keep at it and in no time, you’ll be living off your passive income.</p>
<p>As mentioned above; an admirable tradition which the provostship has
bequeathed to the constablery, the constablery to the <em>maréchaussée</em>,
the <em>maréchaussée</em> to our <em>gendarmeri</em> of Paris.</p>
